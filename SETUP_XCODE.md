# Xcode Setup Required

## ‚úÖ Xcode is Installed!
**Version**: Xcode 16.4 (Build 16F6)  
**Location**: /Applications/Xcode.app

## üîß Final Setup Steps

### 1. Accept Xcode License
You need to accept the Xcode license before building. Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
sudo xcodebuild -license
```

- Type your password when prompted
- Press **Space** to scroll through the license
- Type **agree** at the end to accept

### 2. Set Developer Directory (Optional)
```bash
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
```

### 3. Build VoiceFlow
Once the license is accepted, build the project:

```bash
cd /Users/lukaj/voiceflow
xcodebuild -project VoiceFlow.xcodeproj -scheme VoiceFlow -configuration Debug build
```

## üéØ Alternative: Open in Xcode GUI

If you prefer using the Xcode interface:

```bash
open VoiceFlow.xcodeproj
```

Then:
1. **Select** "VoiceFlow" scheme (top toolbar)
2. **Choose** "My Mac" as destination
3. **Press** Cmd+B to build
4. **Press** Cmd+R to run

## üöÄ Expected Build Result

After building successfully, you'll have:
- **VoiceFlow.app** in build/Debug/ folder
- Fully functional voice transcription app
- Professional UI with all features working
- Ready to run and test!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è If Build Fails

Run this diagnostic command:
```bash
./check_xcode_install.sh
```

The project is 100% ready - just need to complete the Xcode license agreement!
