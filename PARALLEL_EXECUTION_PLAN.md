- Integration testing coordination
- Build system validation

**Responsibilities:**
1. Monitor inter-agent dependencies and conflicts
2. Coordinate file-level changes between agents
3. Resolve integration issues
4. Ensure consistent coding standards

#### Agent 8: Integration Validation Engineer
**Files Assigned:**

- Build verification
- Performance regression testing
- Security validation

**Responsibilities:**

2. Validate all agent implementations work together
3. Performance regression testing
4. Security vulnerability scanning

## Conflict Prevention Strategy

### File-Level Coordination
```
Agent 1 (DI): Core/DependencyInjection/, Core/Protocols/
Agent 2 (Testing): Package.swift, VoiceFlowTests/
Agent 3 (Security): Core/Security/, Services/SessionStorage*, Services/Export/
Agent 4 (Swift6): TranscriptionEngine/, AdvancedApp.swift, ViewModels
Agent 5 (Refactor): Large files (>300 lines), new extracted classes
Agent 6 (Performance): AudioEngine*, AsyncTranscription*, Export optimization
```

### Memory Coordination Points
- `agent_file_locks` - Track which files each agent is modifying
- `integration_checkpoints` - Coordination points between phases
- `conflict_resolution_log` - Track and resolve any conflicts
- `progress_tracking` - Real-time progress monitoring

### Communication Protocol
1. **Before File Modification**: Check and claim file in memory
2. **During Development**: Update progress in memory
3. **After Completion**: Release file lock and notify completion
4. **Integration Points**: Coordinate through memory checkpoints

## Execution Commands

### Phase 1 Launch (Parallel):
```bash
claude-flow sparc run architect "Implement dependency injection architecture for VoiceFlow" &
claude-flow sparc run tester "Create comprehensive testing infrastructure" &
claude-flow sparc run reviewer "Implement security hardening and encryption" &
```

### Phase 2 Launch (Coordinated):
```bash
claude-flow sparc run coder "Fix Swift 6 concurrency compliance issues" &
claude-flow sparc run architect "Refactor God objects and apply SOLID principles" &
claude-flow sparc run optimizer "Implement performance optimizations" &
```

### Phase 3 Launch (Integration):
```bash
claude-flow sparc run coordinator "Monitor and resolve agent conflicts" &
claude-flow sparc run tester "Validate complete system integration" &
```

## Risk Mitigation

1. **File Conflicts**: Memory-based file locking system
2. **Integration Issues**: Staged integration with rollback capability
3. **Performance Regression**: Continuous performance monitoring
4. **Quality Degradation**: Automated testing at each checkpoint
5. **Timeline Overrun**: Parallel execution with clear dependencies
